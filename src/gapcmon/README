GAPCMON (a.k.a gapcmon, and gpanel_apcmon)

	A Gtk2/GLib2 GUI application used to monitor UPS devices controlled
by the APCUPSD package.  The program uses the NIS interface from apcupsd to
collect event and status information for display to the end-user.  Because of
this great (NIS) interface, this program can be executed on any OS supported machine
and use the network socket interface to connect back to apcupsd.  Of course
apcupsd must be compiled with NIS support (i.e. ./configure --enable-nis ).

	One program is included for your use in this package; gapcmon is a 
regular gtk+ application.


FEATURES: 
    * FreeDesktop.org Spec for Notification Area Icons.
    * Unlimited support for multiple UPSs.
    * Historical Graph of five data points are charted.  A total of 40 points
      are maintained on the graph. The data points are LINEV, BATTV, BCHARGE,
      LOADPCT, and TIMELEFT.
    * Clicking an notification icon will cause the information window for that
      monitor to become visible or be hidden, if its already visible.
    * Monitor tooltips are available when hovering the mouse over the icon, and 
      contain a quick summary of the ups status.
    * Icons are dynamically added or removed when enabled in preferences.
    * Icon changes to reflect the operational condition of the UPS.
		- where state is (online, onbattery, charging, not communicating, no cable)
	* right click popup menu with "JumpTo" window and "Quit" window menu choices.
    * Chart support popup tooltip for data point under the mouse pointer, showing
      dataseries name, color, time, and value.
    * Configuration of the tcpi/ip hostname, tcp port number, and whether that
      monitor is current enabled is provided via a central Preferences page.
	* background thread for all network io to keep user interface responsive.
