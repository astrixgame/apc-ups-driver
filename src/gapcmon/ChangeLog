- Removed GTK_STOCK_CLOSE buttons from all windows in response to a
  KDE issue, where KDEs window manager has now decided to ignore
  gtk_window_iconify() api calls.  gtk_widget_hide() is being
  in place of _iconify() however, the close buttons where stranded
  because using _hide at that level could and did cause one or more
  window to be hidden with no tasklist or pager entry to restore
  it with.

  to append the timestamp rather than prepend it.  This corrected the
  presentation of the timestamp to the user in reverse order.
- Constrained the tooltip to present only for actual data points.  It
  was presenting for non-existant data points resulting in time_zero
  display's ( dec 31, 1970...)

gapcmon (0.8.1-0) stable; urgency=normal
* Mon May 8 2006 James Scott, Jr. <skoona@users.sourceforge.net>

- Implemented the FreeDesktop.org spec for notification_area icons
  using modified source from gnome.cvs:libegg.
- Added a paned window to help user manage size of icons and notebooks
- Attempted to implement true alphabetic sort of icons labels, by adding
  label text to main.window icons ( not working the why I would like )
- Reviewed gdk_threads_enter() useage and removed duplicates from
  gtkglgraph.c in response to a user bug ( no x|y-labels on chart-N+1)  
- Several routine consolidated or parameter-ized.

gapcmon (0.6.1-0) stable; urgency=normal
* Sat Apr 1 2006 James Scott, Jr. <skoona@users.sourceforge.net>
- Implemented the tooltip in line graph history page.  Now displays
  the colored point value under the mouse.
- Updated the gapc_monitor_update() in gapcmon_core.c to handle
  the 0-100 percent scale for charted data points.  LINEV uses
  HITRANS as scale and defaults to 120:230, BATTV uses 12:24 unless 
  NOMBATTV is present, and LOADPCT, TIMELEFT, are inversly related to
  each other.  BCHARGE values are taken as is.
- Updated the gapc_util_point_filter_set() in gapcmon_core.c to handle
  out of range graphing data points by defaulting them to 108 percent
  or zero percent.

gapcmon (0.6.0-0) stable; urgency=normal
* Fri Mar 31 2006 James Scott, Jr. <skoona@users.sourceforge.net>
- Implemented the sort_icons function to reorder dynamically
  created monitor icons.

  the gapcmon_gtkglgraph subpackage.  To fix multi-threaded
  operations.
- Integrated the source files into a shared arrangement.
  gapcmon_core.[c|h] gapcmon_gtkglgraph.[c|h] and two
  anchor files gapcmon.h and gpanel_apcmon.c
- Added gtk_glgraph feature to gapcmon replacing the progress
  bars on the overview page.
- Added support for up to eight monitors to gapcmon with the 
  full functionality of gpanel.  commandline take one value
  the instance number, which defaults to zero.
- Reordered preferences columns for better presentation.

gapcmon (0.5.7-3) stable; urgency=normal
* Fri Mar 17 2006 James Scott, Jr. <skoona@users.sourceforge.net>
- Pruned gtkglgraph.c|h of un-used and un-needed routines
- Implemented the none-enabled and COMMLOST program states

gapcmon (0.5.7-2) stable; urgency=normal
* Thu Mar 16 2006 James Scott, Jr. <skoona@users.sourceforge.net>
- Modified gpanel_apcmon.c to handle an unexpected intial state issue
  and some stalled Icon updates issue.
- none-enabled relates to the very first execution without
  gconf2 schemas installed to supply defaults.  This resulted in
  no icons or monitor being enabled, and thus no access to the 
  user interface to request one; or a condition where one icon
  is present but dis-functional.  Fixed
- stalled icons relate to a state where the user has selected
  and repeated deseleted a particular monitor.  The icon for 
  that monitor will default to OFFLINE and not change until
  the UPS actually changes state like to charging, or on battery.
  Fixed.    

gapcmon (0.5.7-0) stable; urgency=normal
* Mon Mar 14 2006 James Scott, Jr. <skoona@users.sourceforge.net>

  Caused two files containing GtkGLGraph to be added;
  gapcmon_gtkglgraph.c and .h The X11 libs are also needed
  by the openGL graphics package.
- gpanel_apcmon is now the only applet version available

gapcmon (0.5.6-0) stable; urgency=normal
* Fri Mar 10 2006 James Scott, Jr. <skoona@users.sourceforge.net>
- Modified gp_mon to be compiled with and without Gtk+Extra-2.1.1
  installed.  gpanel_apcmon.c collection has been removed from
  distribution as gp_mon is a more stable codeset.
- GCONF is newly required for gp_mon to compile period.
