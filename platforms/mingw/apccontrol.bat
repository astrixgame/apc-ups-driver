rem
rem This piece is to substitute the default behaviour with your own script,
rem   perl, C program, etc.
rem
rem You can customize any command by creating an executable file (may be a
rem   script or a compiled program) and naming it the same as the %1 parameter
rem   passed by apcupsd to this script. We will accept files with any extension
rem   included in PATHEXT (*.exe, *.bat, *.cmd, etc).
rem
rem After executing your script, apccontrol continues with the default action.
rem   If you do not want apccontrol to continue, exit your script with exit 
rem   code 99. E.g. "exit /b 99".
rem
rem WARNING: please be aware that if you add any commands before the shutdown
rem   in the downshutdown) case and your command errors or stalls, it will
rem   prevent your machine from being shutdown, so test, test, test to
rem   make sure it works correctly.
rem
rem The apccontrol.bat file will be replaced every time apcupsd is installed,
rem   so do NOT make event modifications in this file. Instead, override the
rem   event actions using event scripts as described above.
rem

rem Use CALL here because event script might be a batch file itself
CALL ".\%command%" 2> NUL

rem This is retarded. "IF ERRORLEVEL 99" means greater-than-or-
rem equal-to 99, so we have to synthesize an == using two IFs. 
rem Ahh, the glory of Windows batch programming. At least they 
rem gave us a NOT op.
