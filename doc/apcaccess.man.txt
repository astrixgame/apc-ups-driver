NAME
     apcinfo — retrieve status information from apcupsd(8)

SYNOPSIS
     apcinfo [-f <config-file>] [-h <host>[:<port>]] [-p <parameter-name>] [-u] [<command>] [<host>[:<port>]]

DESCRIPTION
     apcinfo is a program which prints out the complete status of most American Power Conversion Corp. (APC) UPSes provided you have the
     apcupsd(8) daemon installed, properly configured and running. It can access status information from any APC UPS attached to the localhost
     or attached to any computer on the network which is running apcuspd in NIS mode.

     The command line options are:

     -f		configuration file of apcupsd (default is usually /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf)

     -h		hostname and port of apcupsd to communicate with.  The default hostname and port are obtained from the configuration file.

     -p		Report only the value of the named parameter instead of all parameters and values.

     -u		Remove units field for easier parsing by scripts.

     <command>	An optional command, unless a hostname is also being specified. The only implemented command is status Shorthand for status
		localhost:3551.	 This produces a full printout of the available status information for the associated UPS.

     <host>	An optional hostname which may be a bare machine name, fully qualified domain name or IP address.

     :<port>	An optional port number where a hostname argument has been specified. The default is 3551, the official port number assigned by
		IANA for the apcupsd NIS server.  The default hostname and port are obtained from the configuration file.

     apcinfo uses apcupsd's inbuilt Network Information Server (NIS) -- no relation to Sun's NIS/YP service -- to obtain the current status
     information from the UPS on the local or remote computer. It is therefore necessary to have the following configuration directives:

	     NETSERVER on
	     NISPORT 3551

     in the /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf configuration file so that the Network Information Server will be accessible.  Firewall rules for appro‐
     priate network access may also be needed.

STATUS REPORT FORMAT
     The status report output format is simple ASCII. Generally there is a single piece of information on each line of output. The content
     varies based on the model of UPS being used and, in some cases, the firmware version.

EXAMPLES
     Set out below is a sample of the status output which may be generated for the specified UPS models.
